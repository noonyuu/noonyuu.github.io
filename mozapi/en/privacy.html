    <p class="updated">Last updated: January 8, 2026</p>

    <h2>About the Handling of Facial Data</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> This app does not collect, store, or transmit facial data.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Facial Data Collected</h3>
    <p>This app <strong>does not</strong> collect facial data. It uses Apple's Vision framework to detect the location (coordinate information) of faces in real time on the user's device. However, this information is used only in temporary memory and is not permanently stored.</p>

    <h3>Purpose of Use of Facial Data</h3>
    <p>Facial location information is used only for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To identify the location of faces in an image and apply a mosaic or emoji</li>
      <li>To apply effects to facial areas manually selected by the user</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of this processing is performed locally on the device, and the coordinate information is discarded once processing is complete.</p>

    <h3>Sharing with Third Parties</h3>
    <p>Facial data <strong>is not shared with third parties</strong>. This app does not have network communication capabilities and does not send any data, including facial location information, to external servers.</p>

    <h3>Data Storage Location</h3>
    <p>Face location information is <strong>not stored</strong>. It temporarily resides in your device's memory (RAM) during processing, but is immediately discarded when you close the app or select another image.</p>

    <h3>Data Retention Period</h3>
    <p>Face location information has a retention period of <strong>zero</strong>. The data is not stored permanently; it is used temporarily only during the image processing session.</p>

    <h2>Technical Implementation Details</h2>
    <p>This app uses the following technologies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Apple Vision Framework</strong>: Apple's native framework for on-device face detection</li>
      <li><strong>On-Device Processing</strong>: All image processing is completed on the user's device</li>
      <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong>: Analytics service provided by Google for app usage analysis</li>
      <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong>: Advertising platform provided by Google for ad delivery</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>This app does not store image or facial data on external servers. All processing is performed on the device. Processed images are saved to the device's photo library only if the user chooses to save them.</p>

    <h2>Provision to Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We will not sell, rent, or share your personal information (including facial data) with third parties.</p>
    <p>However, as described in the "Information Collection by Analytics and Advertising Services" section above, information necessary for app usage analysis and ad delivery is sent to Google through Firebase Analytics and Google AdMob. For details on how these services handle data, please refer to their respective privacy policies.</p>
